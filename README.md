• Performed Comprehensive Data Analysis: The project analyzed a dataset containing multiple drug reviews, identifying the total number of unique drugs, the most popular drugs based on review counts, and the classification of drugs used. This included visualizations such as bar charts to represent the top 20 most popular drugs and the least popular ones, providing a clear understanding of drug popularity and usage patterns.

• Temporal Analysis of Reviews: Conducted a detailed temporal analysis of the reviews, assessing the distribution of ratings and useful counts over time. This involved grouping data by date and plotting the amount of review activity and rating distributions over specific time frames, such as monthly or yearly, to observe trends and fluctuations in drug review metrics over time.
